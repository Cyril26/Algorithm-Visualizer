## Features
- **Sorting Section**: Visualize and understand the following sorting algorithms:
  - Bubble Sort
  - Selection Sort
  - Insertion Sort

- **Pathfinding Section**: Explore the workings of various pathfinding algorithms:
  - A* (A Star)
  - Dijkstra's Algorithm
  - Breadth-First Search (BFS)
  - Depth-First Search (DFS)

## Sorting Algorithms
### Bubble Sort
A simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.

### Selection Sort
An in-place comparison sorting algorithm that divides the input list into two parts: a sorted and an unsorted section, repeatedly selecting the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted section.

### Insertion Sort
A simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one item at a time, with the idea of inserting each new element into its correct position.

## Pathfinding Algorithms
### A* (A Star)
An informed search algorithm that finds the shortest path between nodes by using heuristics to guide its search.

### Dijkstra's Algorithm
An algorithm for finding the shortest paths between nodes in a graph, which may represent, for example, road networks.

### Breadth-First Search (BFS)
An algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures, exploring all neighbors at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level.

### Depth-First Search (DFS)
An algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures, prioritizing depth over breadth.
