        As useful as the BFS: DFS can be used to generate a topological
        ordering, to generate mazes, to traverse trees, to build decision trees,
        to discover a solution path with hierarchical choicesâ€¦

      <p>
        This may be the algorithm of choice to identify nearby places of
        interest in GPS.

      <p>DFS does not guarantee the shortest path.</p>
